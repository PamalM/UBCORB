# UBCO Room Booking Application
    What is UBCORB?:
  UBCORB originally started as a 2020 Hackathon project; The purpose of this application is to provide an efficient and simple way for students to book study spaces on University of British Columbia - Okanagan (UBCO). The current method for booking study spaces requires users to utilize UBC's study booking website; Which isn't optimized for mobile browsers and/or smaller devices. Personally, as a student myself I understand the annoyance that comes with booking study spaces on campus; This application is designed to serve the students of UBCO. 

*Please note, this project is also a submission for a COSC 341 - Human Computer Interaction Assignment.*
