# UBCORB
UBCO Hackathon 2020 Project. Implementing a android application that takes student preferences for room#, building, time and date to search online for available study rooms with specified preferences from the student.
Desired Goal: Provide SQL database with parameters (information from text Boxes) to conduct search. Once the search is completed, the result page will display all avaliable study rooms on campus for the specified date/time specified. Users will also have 
the opportunity to filter these search results using drop down menus.
