# UBCORB

**What is UBCORB?:**
UBCORB originally started as a 2020 Hackathon project; The purpose of this application is to provide an efficient and simple way for students to book study spaces on University of British Columbia - Okanagan (UBCO). The current method for booking study spaces requires users to utilize UBC's study booking website; Which isn't optimized for mobile browsers and/or smaller devices. Personally, as a student myself i understand the annoyance that comes with booking study spaces on campus; This application is designed to serve the students of UBCO. 

*Please note, this project is also a submission for a COSC 341 - Human Computer Interaction Assignment.*

**To execute the project, please either download (.zip) or clone the repository into Android Studio. The development was executed using the Pixel API 28, but also is optimized for the Pixel 3 API 28; However, with the help of constraints, the application should be optimized to run on most android devices.**
